# Spin-Decoherence---CCE
The Python code files for simulating spin decoherence in the VOTPP and Cumnt molecules using the Cluster-Correlation Expansion (CCE) method.

The code files calculate the individual contributions to decoherence of the electronic and nuclear spin baths of bath molecules modelled both as bound and free electron spins.

This repository contains the necessary Python code to calculate convergence CCE parameters for all bath cases of bath molecules and simulate converged decoherence dynamics using these parameters.
